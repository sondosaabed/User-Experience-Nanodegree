# User-Experience: Nanodegree
I acquired a full scholarship from Google Palestine Launchpad to study the fundamentals of Design Research and User Experience.

The UX Fundamentals & Design Research program taught me the core principles of human-centered design, including how to scope design problems, conduct in-depth interviews, and create effective quantitative surveys. I gained hands-on experience in collecting and analyzing user research data to uncover meaningful opportunities, and I learned to apply psychology to design sketches while keeping the end user at the heart of the process.
